## Hello!!

#### My name is Zach Bush, thanks for visiting my website today!!

### School

I am currently in my final semester at the University of California at Berkeley.
I am a computer science major in the College of Letters and Sciences.

### Work

I currently work as a software engineer at [Meraki][meraki], which was recently
acquired by [Cisco systems][cisco].

Previously, I have worked as a math tutor at [Sierra College] [sierra], and as
a CS tutor for Java, C++, Bash, Python, and data structures at UC Berkeley, as
well as an undergraduate student instructor for [CS61C][cs61c], which deals
with the internal organization of computers. I have also done consulting work
for [Indowsway Software][indowsway] (where I worked on maintaining a library of
FORTRAN bindings for WinAPI) and [Berkeley Simulation Software][bss] (where I
worked on the company's product Rail Traffic Controller, as well as updating
their website).

### Fun times

In my free time (of which I have almost none) I enjoy working on
[hobby coding projects][projects], as well as occasional hardware hacking. I
like to go on hikes, bike rides, and other things of the sort, regretfully, not
as often as I once did. I also play the guitar (poorly).

I like to cook, play with Legos, hang out with [my girlfriend][molly], and see
[my friends][Roomies]. I love visiting with my family, especially my baby
nephew [Landon][landon].
