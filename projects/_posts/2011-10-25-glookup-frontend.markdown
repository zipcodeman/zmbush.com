I started this project in late 2011 on a whim. I was feeling sick and I had
gone home early, out of boredom, I started working on this project. 

After several hours, I managed to have a working product that did what I
wanted. Over the next couple days, I worked on it to make it better and fix
bugs. 

The code is available at: [github.com](https://github.com/zipcodeman/glookup-frontend)

You can download the app from the [Android
Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=zipcodeman.glookup)
