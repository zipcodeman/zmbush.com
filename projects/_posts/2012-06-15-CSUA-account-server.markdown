snippet: |
  This was created to help to modernize the account creation system for UC
  Berkeley's Computer Science Undergraduate Association. The account creation
  will now be done by a web form.

This project is still in progress, but when completed, will make the creation of
accounts for the CSUA much easier for the Technical Vice President to handle. 

This project was done in conjunction with {{ site.partners.mary }} and 
{{ site.partners.josh }}.
