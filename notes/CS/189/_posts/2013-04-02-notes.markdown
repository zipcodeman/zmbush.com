## Decision Trees

### Classification Trees

$$f:x \rightarrow \{ 1, -1 \} $$

- Averaging
- Boosting

{% graphviz classtree dot %}
digraph {
  "Question1"->"Question3"[label="NO"];
  "Question1"->"Question2"[label="Yes"];
}
{% endgraphviz %}

#### Training Time
- Construct the tree
  - Pick the questions at each node.
- Stop growing the tree when too few points at a leaf
- How to generate questions??????

#### Test Time
- Traverse the tree (Some path from root to leaf)
- Take a majority from the examples on the leaf

### Regression Trees

$$f:x \rightarrow y \in \mathbb{R}$$

- Average Y of points at the leaf node
