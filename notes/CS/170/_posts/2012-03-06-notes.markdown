# Set Cover

K lists that cover.

    [.....]
    [.....]
    [.....]
    [.....]

Except for the other lists. 

The greedy algorithm is not optimal, but will find a very good solution. 

> This problem is **NP-Complete**. 

The greedy algorithm picks the set with the most remaining elements. 
* not optimal, but will perform fine.

## How fine?

The greedy alway picks at least 1/k remaining elements.

    After Step 1:
      Elements remaining <= (1 - 1/k)*n
