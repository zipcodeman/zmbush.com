##Dealing with hard problems once we have proven that they are NP-Complete

* Branch and Bound
* Exhaustive search

## Approximation
A(I)

Algorithm A (minimization problem)

    $$ \max_I \frac{A(I)}{Opt(I)} = \alpha_A $$


For set cover, $!\alpha\_{greedy} \le \ln n!$

    VC = NULL
    While G has edges
    Pick an edge [u, v]
    VC = VC + u + v
    delete u, and v from G

    D = set of deleted edges
    A(G) = 2|D|
    $!opt(G) \ge |D|!$
    $!\alpha_A \le 2!$
