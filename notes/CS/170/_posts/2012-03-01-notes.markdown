1. Huffman Codes
    * Compression
    * Given a long file, make it shorter
    * 16 Characters alphabet, four bits/character
    * One idea: shorter representation of frequent characters
    * DNA example
    > consists of letters A C T G with varying frequencies
      A: .4
      C: .1
      T: .2
      G: .3
    * Expected representation for N characters: 2N
    * Prefix free codes work better than fixed length codes! 1.9N < 2N
    * Given symbol Frequencies f1, ..., fn find "best" prefix code.
    * Smallest average length
    * Cost of prefix tree with symbol leaves:
    > sum of all the frequencies times the depth in the tree
    * Example: (A, .4), (C, .1), (T, .2), (G, .3)
