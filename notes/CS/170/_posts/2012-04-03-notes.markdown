Two person zero sum games.

$!m \times n!$ payoff matrix G.

Row mixed strategy: $!x = (x\_1, \dots, x\_m)!$
Column mixed strategy: $!y = (y\_1, \dots y\_n)!$

Payoff for strategy pair $!(x, y)!$:

$$p(x,y) = x^TGy$$

That is,

    $$\sum_i x_i \left(\sum_j Gi,jy_i \right) = \sum_j (\sum_i x_i G i,j) y_j$$
