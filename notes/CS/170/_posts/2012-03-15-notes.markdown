Linear programming is a problem that is extremely useful in such a way as many
other problems reduce to it. 

Maximize $!x\_1 + 6x\_2!$

    $$
    x_1 \le 200
    x_2 \le 300
    x_1 + x_2 \le 400
    x_1, x_2 \ge 0
    $$

Construct a feasible region by graphing the constraints. 

## Simplex Algorithm (Local Search)

Pick a vertex. From this vertex, we can see x other vertices. Are these options
better? Pick one. 

Imagine that we add an even more lucrative product. 

Maximize $!x\_1 + 6x\_2 + 13x\_3!$

    $$
    x_1 \le 200
    x_2 \le 300
    x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \le 400
    x_1, x_2 \ge 0
    x_2 + 3x_3 \le 600
    $$

Via both algebra and simplex, we can show that the maximum of this system is
$!3100!$

### An example from the book.
Let's say you are running a business, where you know the demand for products
$!d\_1, \dots, d\_12!$ for each months of the year. 

We have 30 employees that can each produce 20 units/month

Workers can work overtime for $!80\%!$ more money. 

You can also hire or fire. Hiring costs $320, Firing costs $400. 

Workers get $2000 per month

You can also store at $8/unit/month

Variables?
  
    $!x_i!$: units made
    $!w_i!$: workers  ($!w_1 = 30!$)
    $!y_i!$: units made by overtime
    $!h_i, f_i!$: Workers hired/fired
    $!s_i!$: Units Stored

    $$
    x_i, w_i, y_i, f_i, h_i, s_i \ge 0
    x_i = 20w_i + y_i
    w_i = w_{i-1} + h_i - f_i
    s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i - d_i
    y_i \le 6w_i
    $$

    Minimize: 
    $$
    \sum_{i = 1}^{12}(2000w_i + 320h_i + 400f_i + 8s_i + 180y_i)
    $$
