Linear programming is a problem that is extremely useful in such a way as many
other problems reduce to it. 

Maximize $!x\_1 + 6x\_2!$

    $$
    x_1 \le 200
    x_2 \le 300
    x_1 + x_2 \le 400
    x_1, x_2 \ge 0
    $$

Construct a feasible region by graphing the constraints. 

## Simplex Algorithm (Local Search)

Pick a vertex. From this vertex, we can see x other vertices. Are these options
better? Pick one. 

Imagine that we add an even more lucrative product. 

Maximize $!x\_1 + 6x\_2 + 13x\_3!$

    $$
    x_1 \le 200
    x_2 \le 300
    x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \le 400
    x_1, x_2 \ge 0
    x_2 + 3x_3 \le 600
    $$
