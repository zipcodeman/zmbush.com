# Dynamic Programming

* Increasing subsequence DAG
* Knapsack DAG

$!n^2!$ subproblems, where you need to look at $!n!$ other subproblems each
time. Therefore the running time is: $$O(n^3)$$

## How can we improve on DP?

$$900,300,400,200,1100;2000$$

is the same as:

$$9,3,4,2,11;20$$


## A new kind of problem

Independent set problem.

     /-------\
     o - o - o
    /| / | \ | \
    |o - o - o - o
    \| \ | / | /
     o - o - o
     \-------/

NP complete problem.
