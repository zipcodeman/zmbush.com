# Dynamic Programming

* Increasing subsequence DAG
* Knapsack DAG

$!n^2!$ subproblems, where you need to look at $!n!$ other subproblems each
time. Therefore the running time is: $$O(n^3)$$

## How can we improve on DP?

$$900,300,400,200,1100;2000$$

is the same as:

$$9,3,4,2,11;20$$


## A new kind of problem

Independent set problem.

     /-------\
     o - o - o
    /| / | \ | \
    |o - o - o - o
    \| \ | / | /
     o - o - o
     \-------/

NP complete problem.

If the given graph is a tree, the problem is easily solved with dynamic
programming!
     
            o
      /----/|\-----\
     o      |      o
    /|\     o     / \
    ooo    / \    o o
           | o
          / \
          o o

Dynamic programming for tree. 

    Sub problem = Sub tree(Vertex)

Algorithm:

    For every node of the tree from the leaves up:
      if v is a leaf:
        I(v) = 1
      else:
        I(v) = max($!\sum_{\text{u, child of v}} I(u)!$, $!1 + \sum_{\text{u, grandchild of v}} I(u)!$)


Very useful for solving hard problems on trees.

## Shortest Path (With a twist)

Shortest path from $!s!$ with $!\le k!$ hops.

Penalized long paths!

DYNAMICPROGRAMMING!!!!!!!!!

    For every node in the tree:
      $!dist[v, k] = \text{The length of the shortest path from s to v, with k
                           edges}!$
