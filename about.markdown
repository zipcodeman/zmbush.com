Hello, My name is Zach Bush, thanks for visiting my website today!

I am currently in my final semester at the University of California at Berkeley.
I am a computer science major in the college of letters and sciences.  I work
part time at [Meraki](http://www.meraki.com), which was recently acquired by
[Cisco systems](http://www.cisco.com). I also work as a undergraduate student
instructor for [CS61C](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp13).
